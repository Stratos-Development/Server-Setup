# How to setup portainer agent
1. Create a directory in your home directory to store the docker-compose file (Ex: /home/gavin/dev/docker/ptagent)
2. ** GO INTO THE DIRECTORY YOU CREATED **
3. Create a file called docker-compose.yml (nano docker-compose) and add the code from docker-compose.yml.
4. Next deploy the docker compose file by doing the following command
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
8. Add ptagent to your portainer instance (Im not telling you how to do this you should know)
