# Vaultwarden Setup 

1. Go into portainer and create a new stack and name it Vaultwarden/bitwarden.
2. Copy the text from docker-compose.yml into the stack config.



(Note: You can change the token. You don't really have to since it's inhouse.)


# What is Vaultwarden

Alternative implementation of the Bitwarden server API written in Rust and compatible with upstream Bitwarden clients*, perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be ideal.
